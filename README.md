<h2 align="center">Hey there 👋 I'm Ester!</h2>

<p align="justify">
I'm a developer passionate about developer experience, system architecture, and code quality. I hold a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, as well as a postgraduate degree in Data Science. I'm naturally curious and believe in continuous learning as a way to improve not just as a developer, but as a human being.
